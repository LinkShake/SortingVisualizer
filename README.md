### SortingVisualizer Project

SortingVisualizer is a visualizer for arrays' sorting algorithms. I coded it with Svelte.js and created also some cool animations thanks to Svelte fantastic builtin animations library and its ease of use.
To run the project locally, clone the repo and, when you're done, run

```
npm install
```

to install all the dependencies and then

```
npm run dev
```

to start the project locally (the port it will run is not always the same for every user).
